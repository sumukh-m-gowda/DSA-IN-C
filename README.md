# Types of Trees ðŸŒ³

Trees are a fundamental data structure in computer science, used to represent hierarchical relationships. This document covers several key types of trees, forming the basis for many efficient algorithms and data organization systems.

---

## 1. Binary Trees

The **Binary Tree** is the most basic specialized tree structure.

* **Rule:** Each node in a Binary Tree can have **up to two children**â€”a **left child node** and a **right child node**.
* **Foundation:** This simple structure is the foundation for more complex and optimized tree types like Binary Search Trees (BSTs) and AVL Trees.

---

## 2. Binary Search Trees (BSTs)

A **Binary Search Tree** imposes an ordering rule on the basic Binary Tree structure, making it highly efficient for searching and sorting.

* **Rule:** For **every node**, the following must be true:
    * The value of the **left child node** (and all nodes in the left subtree) must be **less than** the parent node's value.
    * The value of the **right child node** (and all nodes in the right subtree) must be **greater than** the parent node's value.
* **Advantage:** This ordered arrangement allows for very quick data retrieval and insertion (on average, $O(\log n)$ time complexity).

---

## 3. AVL Trees

An **AVL Tree** (named after its inventors, Adelson-Velsky and Landis) is a self-balancing version of a Binary Search Tree.

* **Key Feature: Self-Balancing:** For every node, the difference in **height** between the left subtree and the right subtree is **at most one**. This difference is known as the **Balance Factor**.
* **Mechanism:** This balance is maintained automatically through special operations called **rotations** whenever a node is inserted or deleted.
* **Advantage:** By maintaining balance, the worst-case search time complexity is guaranteed to remain $O(\log n)$, preventing performance degradation that can happen in an unbalanced BST.

## ðŸ’¡ Next Steps

Each of these data structures will be described in detail in subsequent pages, including:

* Interactive animations of insertions and deletions.
* Guides on how to implement them in code.
